# Web Development Project

Welcome to my web development project! This is a basic project where I'll be applying what I've learned in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

In this project, I'll be working on creating a simple website or web application. The primary technologies I'll be using are:
- HTML: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- CSS: For styling and layout to make the project visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learningProject.git
